{"name":"Gummi","tagline":"Simple LaTeX editor","body":"# Gummi; the simple LaTeX editor\r\nWelcome to the new official home for Gummi. It's good to be back. I've decided to make a short FAQ to answer some of the questions you may have had while the original website was offline. \r\n\r\n![Alt text](/../screenshots/screenshots/gummi-065-main.png?raw=true \"gummi 0.6.5 main\")\r\n\r\n##### Are you going to continue development?\r\nYes, I will start working on a new bugfix release right away. No release date yet, but it shouldn't take long to fix some of the minor existing annoyances. \r\n\r\n##### What about implementing feature X?\r\nUnfortunately other projects I am currently working on take priority for the time being. There are some architectural aspects about the Gummi codebase that make popular requests like improved project support difficult to implement properly without some mayor reform. I'd probably do a complete rewrite of Gummi in Python or Vala if I had unlimited time, but unfortunately our reality does not work that way ;) - That said, I'm hopeful that this move to Github will bring in new contributions. \r\n\r\n##### Is there ever going to be a non-beta release of the Windows version?\r\nThat depends if someone wants to pick up the work. I have no personal interest in the Windows platform, and as noted before.. limited time to spend on Gummi development. If you're up for the task, let me know and I'll do my best to help you. \r\n\r\n##### Where can I find the documentation that was available on the original website?\r\n\r\nThe documentation, written by Guy Edwards, is now available as a Github wiki [here](https://github.com/alexandervdm/gummi/wiki). The menu link in your current version of Gummi may however still point to the wrong URL. \r\n\r\n#### Contact\r\n\r\nIf you wish to contact me, please use the contact details on my Github profile. I can also usually be found idling on the FreeNode IRC network as 'alexandervdm'. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
