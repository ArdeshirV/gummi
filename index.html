<p>Welcome to the new official home for Gummi. It's good to be back. I've decided to make a short FAQ to answer some of the questions you may have had while the original website was offline. </p>

<a id="are-you-going-to-continue-development" class="anchor" href="#are-you-going-to-continue-development" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Are you going to continue development?</h5>

<p>Yes, I will start working on a new bugfix release right away. No release date yet, but it shouldn't take long to fix some of the minor existing annoyances. </p>

<a id="what-about-implementing-feature-x" class="anchor" href="#what-about-implementing-feature-x" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What about implementing feature X?</h5>

<p>Unfortunately other projects I am currently working on take priority for the time being. There are some architectural aspects about the Gummi codebase that make popular requests like improved project support difficult to implement properly without some mayor reform. I'd probably do a complete rewrite of Gummi in Python or Vala if I had unlimited time, but unfortunately our reality does not work that way ;) - That said, I'm hopeful that this move to Github will bring in new contributions. </p>

<p>That depends if someone wants to pick up the work. I have no personal interest in the Windows platform, and as noted before.. limited time to spend on Gummi development. If you're up for the task, let me know and I'll do my best to help you. </p>

<p>The documentation, written by Guy Edwards, is now available as a Github wiki <a href="https://github.com/alexandervdm/gummi/wiki">here</a>. The menu link in your current version of Gummi may however still point to the wrong URL. </p>

<p>If you wish to contact me, please use the contact details on my Github profile. I can also usually be found idling on the FreeNode IRC network as 'alexandervdm'. </p>
